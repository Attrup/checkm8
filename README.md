# Chess Engine Starter Kit

This repo serves as a decent starting position for implementing your own chess engine. Communication over UCI (Universal Chess Interface) with an external GUI is handled so you can focus on the fun part - searching for good moves to make. The Rust crate `shakmaty` is used for state and move generation, so you don't have to implement the mechanics of chess yourselves.

# How to get started
1. Install [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) (if you haven't already).
2. Install [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) (for maximal convenience).
3. Install a UCI compatible chess GUI like [En Croissant](https://encroissant.org/download).
4. Fork the repo and start coding.
